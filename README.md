# Running Analytics Hub

A modular, open-source project for runners and coaches to analyze running data, visualize training history, detect metric changes, and generate summaries using machine learning and language models.

## üöÄ Project Goals

* Provide a user-friendly web interface to visualize and analyze running data.
* Offer detailed breakdowns of performance metrics over time.
* Detect changes in performance using machine learning.
* Summarize recent workouts and trends using a local LLM.
* Use open-source tools, containerized deployment, and modular architecture.

| DevOps Monitoring | Grafana + Prometheus (for server/app health)           |

## üîÑ Data Sources

* **Strava API** (preferred for historical + social data)
* **Coros Export Files** (local device-based JSON/CSV/GPX)
* **Apple Health** (via HealthKit exports or 3rd-party tools)

## üì¶ Initial Features (Phase 1)

* [ ] Dockerized Flask backend + Postgres DB
* [ ] GPX file upload and heatmap visualization
* [ ] Metrics analysis dashboard (HR, cadence, stride length, power)
* [ ] Time-based filters for session comparison
* [ ] Simple ML change detection (e.g., stride length anomalies)
* [ ] LLM summarizer API for weekly insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture (Simplified)

```
[ User Interface (Flask/Dash) ]
          |
  [ Metrics API / Upload API ]
          |
    [ Postgres + PostGIS ]
          |
   [ ML Pipeline (sklearn, etc) ]
          |
 [ Local LLM Summary Engine ]
          |
 [ Docker Compose / Monitoring Layer ]
```

## üìÖ Planned Features (Backlog)

* [ ] Authentication (Auth0 or internal)
* [ ] Prefect-based data ingestion workflows
* [ ] REST API endpoints for mobile app access
* [ ] Integration with training plans & schedule data
* [ ] Personalized recommendations engine (e.g., "your stride length has dropped 4% since your last race")
* [ ] Multi-user support and role-based access
* [ ] Export to PDF reports
* [ ] Real-time metrics overlay via smartwatch connection (stretch goal)

## üìö Documentation

* Written with Markdown + MkDocs for clean, static documentation.
* Dev and data onboarding guides.
* Example GPX, JSON, and dashboard previews included.

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

* Fork the repo and set up Docker locally.
* Submit well-documented pull requests.
* Open issues for bugs, feature requests, or ideas.
